# MarketQuantify: Algorithmic Delta-Neutralization for Forex Binary Options

MarketQuantify provides a robust framework for pricing and automatically executing delta-neutralized positions in Forex binary options using stochastic implied volatility surfaces. This project leverages advanced quantitative techniques and a high-performance Go implementation to enable efficient and reliable algorithmic trading strategies.

The core objective of MarketQuantify is to provide a competitive edge in the Forex binary options market by accurately pricing options and mitigating directional risk through dynamic delta hedging. The system constructs implied volatility surfaces from market data, incorporates stochastic models to account for volatility uncertainty, and employs sophisticated numerical methods for option pricing. It then calculates the delta of the option position and dynamically adjusts the underlying Forex asset holdings to maintain a delta-neutral portfolio, minimizing exposure to short-term price fluctuations. Automated execution capabilities allow for the rapid deployment of these strategies in live trading environments.

This project is designed to be highly modular and extensible. The architecture allows for easy integration of different stochastic volatility models, option pricing methodologies, and execution venues. The use of Go ensures efficient performance, low latency, and scalability, crucial for high-frequency trading applications. MarketQuantify aims to empower quantitative traders and developers with the tools necessary to research, develop, and deploy sophisticated algorithmic trading strategies for Forex binary options.

MarketQuantify is not only a trading tool but also a research platform. It provides a foundation for experimenting with different volatility models, hedging strategies, and risk management techniques. Backtesting capabilities allow users to evaluate the performance of their strategies under various market conditions. The project encourages collaboration and contribution from the quantitative finance community to continuously improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of the system.

## Key Features

*   **Stochastic Implied Volatility Surface Construction:** Implements a robust method for constructing implied volatility surfaces from market data, accounting for smile and skew effects. The system uses interpolation and extrapolation techniques to create a continuous surface suitable for pricing options at any strike price and time to expiration. Specifically, a cubic spline interpolation with monotonicity constraints is used.
*   **Stochastic Volatility Modeling:** Incorporates stochastic volatility models such as the Heston model and the SABR model to account for volatility uncertainty. These models are calibrated to the implied volatility surface to capture the dynamic behavior of volatility. The system allows for easy integration of other advanced volatility models. Parameter estimation is performed using a combination of least squares and maximum likelihood estimation.
*   **Binary Option Pricing:** Provides accurate pricing of Forex binary options using numerical methods such as the finite difference method and Monte Carlo simulation. The pricing engine takes into account the stochastic volatility surface and the underlying Forex asset price. Supports various binary option types, including cash-or-nothing and asset-or-nothing options.
*   **Delta-Neutralization Strategy:** Implements a dynamic delta-neutralization strategy to mitigate directional risk. The system continuously calculates the delta of the option position and adjusts the underlying Forex asset holdings to maintain a delta-neutral portfolio. The rebalancing frequency can be configured based on market volatility and transaction costs.
*   **Automated Execution:** Enables automated execution of trades through integration with various Forex brokers and exchanges. The system supports different order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders. Order execution is performed asynchronously to minimize latency.
*   **Backtesting Framework:** Offers a comprehensive backtesting framework for evaluating the performance of trading strategies under historical market conditions. The backtesting engine simulates trading activity based on historical data and provides detailed performance metrics such as profit and loss, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.
*   **Risk Management:** Includes built-in risk management features such as position limits, stop-loss orders, and maximum drawdown limits. These features help to protect capital and prevent excessive losses.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, concurrency features, and suitability for building high-frequency trading systems.
*   **Gorgonia:** A library for numerical computation and machine learning in Go, used for option pricing calculations and volatility model calibration.
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store market data, implied volatility surfaces, and trading history.
*   **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for caching and real-time data processing.
*   **gRPC:** A high-performance RPC framework used for inter-service communication.
*   **Docker:** Used for containerization and deployment of the application.

## Configuration

MarketQuantify uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection string. Example: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
*   `REDIS_ADDRESS`: The Redis server address. Example: `localhost:6379`
*   `BROKER_API_KEY`: Your Forex broker API key.
*   `BROKER_API_SECRET`: Your Forex broker API secret.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level. Options: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. Default: `info`.

You can also configure the following parameters in the `config.toml` file:

*   `VolatilityModel`: The stochastic volatility model to use (e.g., "Heston", "SABR").
*   `OptionPricingMethod`: The option pricing method to use (e.g., "FiniteDifference", "MonteCarlo").
*   `DeltaRebalancingFrequency`: The frequency at which the delta is rebalanced (in seconds).
*   `PositionLimit`: The maximum allowed position size.

## Usage

1.  **Build the Application:** Build the MarketQuantify application using the following command:
    `go build -o marketquantify`
2.  **Run the Application:** Run the compiled executable:
    `./marketquantify`
3.  **API Documentation:** The application exposes a gRPC API for interacting with its various components. Refer to the `proto` directory for the API definitions. Use a gRPC client to connect to the server and call the available methods. Example gRPC calls would include:
    *   `GetImpliedVolatilitySurface(ForexPair, ExpiryDate)`: Retrieves the implied volatility surface for a given Forex pair and expiry date.
    *   `PriceBinaryOption(ForexPair, StrikePrice, ExpiryDate, OptionType)`: Prices a binary option.
    *   `CalculateDelta(ForexPair, StrikePrice, ExpiryDate, OptionType)`: Calculates the delta of a binary option.
    *   `ExecuteTrade(ForexPair, Quantity, Side)`: Executes a trade on the Forex market.
