# MarketQuantify: Real-Time Financial Data Analysis and Algorithmic Trading Framework

MarketQuantify is a high-performance, modular framework built in Go for real-time financial data analysis, backtesting, and algorithmic trading. It empowers developers and quantitative analysts to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy sophisticated trading strategies. By leveraging Go's concurrency and performance capabilities, MarketQuantify provides a robust and scalable platform for handling large volumes of market data and executing complex calculations with minimal latency.

This project aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application in the financial markets. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for data ingestion, pre-processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Whether you're a seasoned quant trader or a developer venturing into algorithmic trading, MarketQuantify provides the building blocks you need to develop and refine your strategies. The framework is designed to be extensible and adaptable, allowing you to seamlessly integrate custom data sources, trading algorithms, and risk management modules.

MarketQuantify is more than just a collection of libraries; it's a cohesive ecosystem for building intelligent trading systems. It emphasizes modularity and separation of concerns, enabling you to easily manage the complexity of real-world trading scenarios. From simple moving average crossovers to complex machine learning models, MarketQuantify equips you with the tools to navigate the dynamic landscape of the financial markets. The focus is on providing speed and reliability, ensuring that your trading decisions are executed with precision and efficiency.

## Key Features

*   **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Supports integration with various real-time data feeds (e.g., Alpaca, Polygon.io) through gRPC based data stream handlers. Implements robust error handling and reconnection mechanisms to ensure data integrity. Each data stream handler implements the `DataStreamHandler` interface, ensuring consistent data formats across providers.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** A highly configurable backtesting engine allows for rigorous evaluation of trading strategies against historical data. Supports tick-by-tick backtesting, variable transaction costs, and slippage simulation. Implements an event-driven architecture for efficient simulation of market events.
*   **Technical Indicator Library:** A comprehensive library of pre-built technical indicators, including moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands. Indicators are implemented as independent modules with well-defined interfaces, allowing for easy customization and extension. Implements vectorized calculations for maximum performance.
*   **Order Management System:** A robust order management system handles order placement, tracking, and execution. Supports various order types (e.g., market, limit, stop-loss). Integrates with multiple brokers through a standardized API. Uses a concurrent queue to manage incoming and outgoing order requests.
*   **Risk Management Module:** Implements various risk management techniques, including position sizing, stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification. Allows for dynamic adjustment of risk parameters based on market conditions. Utilizes a risk scoring system based on volatility and correlation analysis.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The entire framework is built on an event-driven architecture, allowing for decoupled components and asynchronous processing. This enhances scalability and responsiveness to real-time market events. Uses channels for inter-process communication and goroutines for concurrent execution.
*   **Modular Design:** The framework is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and customization. Components can be easily swapped out or extended to meet specific requirements. Each module exposes a well-defined API for seamless integration with other parts of the system.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, concurrency, and static typing.
*   **gRPC:** Used for high-performance inter-process communication between data providers and the core framework.
*   **Protobuf:** Used for defining data structures and service definitions in gRPC.
*   **Redis:** Used for caching market data and storing session information.
*   **PostgreSQL:** Used for persistent storage of historical data, account balances, and trade history.
*   **Docker:** Used for containerization, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/MarketQuantify.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd MarketQuantify
3.  Install dependencies using Go modules:
    go mod download
    go mod tidy
4.  Set up your environment variables (see Configuration section below).
5.  Build the project:
    go build -o marketquantify cmd/marketquantify/main.go
6.  (Optional) Build the Docker image:
    docker build -t marketquantify .

## Configuration

MarketQuantify relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the following variables:

*   `DATA_PROVIDER_URL`: The URL of the data provider gRPC server. Example: `localhost:50051`
*   `REDIS_ADDR`: The address of the Redis server. Example: `localhost:6379`
*   `POSTGRES_HOST`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL server. Example: `localhost`
*   `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port number of the PostgreSQL server. Example: `5432`
*   `POSTGRES_USER`: The username for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
*   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
*   `POSTGRES_DB`: The name of the PostgreSQL database.

Example .env file:
DATA_PROVIDER_URL=localhost:50051
REDIS_ADDR=localhost:6379
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=marketquantify
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=securepassword
POSTGRES_DB=marketquantify_db

## Usage

To run MarketQuantify, execute the compiled binary:
./marketquantify

The framework exposes a gRPC API for interacting with its various components. Example client code (using Go's gRPC library):



Replace `path/to/your/protobuf/definitions` with the actual path to your generated protobuf files. Refer to the gRPC documentation for more detailed examples and API specifications.
